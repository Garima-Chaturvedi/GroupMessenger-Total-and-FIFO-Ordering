Here I have implemented ordering guarantees to my group messenger communicating among 5 devices. The guarantees implemented are total ordering as well as FIFO ordering. All the messages are stored in the mobiles content provider. The stored messages are assigned sequence numbers, and this implementation provides total and FIFO ordering guarantees. This supports upto 5 mobile devices for group messaging. This implementation also handles failure of upto 1 application at a time and during and after failure guarantees the Total and FIFO ordering of messages recieved before and after the failure from rest of the devices.
